# üßê Project philosophy

> This is an IoT based device which helps you to update your slack status on your fingertips.
> I have included 5 status you just need to press it and change the slack status as written on it.
> If you are a person who uses slack on daily basis, then you need to change your slack status frequently. That's why I made this IoT device for that

**I got inspiration from this blog(https://www.instructables.com/Slack-Status-Updater-With-ESP8266).**


# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack this device uses:

- The code is written in C++ language and I have used Ardiuno Ide.
- Development board I used is esp8266

# ‚úçÔ∏è How to make one 

- You need an IoT board ex: Esp8266 or Esp32
- Install all libraries (see the blog)
- Create a slack app
- Install it you are ready

# üåü Spread the word!
